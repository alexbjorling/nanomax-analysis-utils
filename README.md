Installation:

From the main folder, to install for the current user.
python setup.py install --user

Note that use of scanViewer and other GUIs require the silx
package, which can be installed for the current userthrough pip.
pip install silx --user

Currently, an update in the silx library causes masses of
deprecation warnings. This will be fixed soon.
