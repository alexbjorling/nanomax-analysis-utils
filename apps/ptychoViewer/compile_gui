# If the gui is modified, the .ui file has to be compiled. First
# compile the gui using either pyuic4/pyrcc4 or pyuic5/pyrcc5
pyuic4 design.ui -o design.py
pyrcc4 design.qrc -o design_rc.py

# and then adjust the imports to use silx rather than PyQt, in both
# design.py and design_rc.py.
#
# Example:
#
# #from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets
# from silx.gui import qt as QtCore
# QtGui = QtCore
# QtWidgets = QtCore
